Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I'm a first year PhD students in [Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). Previously, I majored in mathematics and statistics in Peking University, where I spent great four years in Yuanpei College and I was very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com) from 2018 to 2021. Besides, I was pleased to be a research assistant with Professor [Zheng Tracy Ke](http://zke.fas.harvard.edu) from Harvard University during summer in 2019.

Motivated by the enthusiasm about both math and real life, I'm quite open to a lot of topics, including causal inference, statistical learning and interdisciplinary study with real data. My previous research mainly focus on applied projects related to air pollution and COVID-19. There we develop and use statistical method to evaluate air pollution in China, and help with the evaluation and prediction of the global pandemic. Now I'm working with Professor [Peng Ding](https://sites.google.com/site/pengdingpku/home?authuser=0) on causal inference. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.
