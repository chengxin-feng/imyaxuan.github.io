Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a first year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). Previously, I majored in mathematics and statistics in Peking University, where I spent four years great in Yuanpei College and was very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com). Besides, I also had the pleasure of being a research assistant with Professor [Zheng Tracy Ke](http://zke.fas.harvard.edu) from Harvard University during the summer of 2019. My full CV is available here.

As for research interests, motivated by my enthusiasm about both math and real life, I'm open to a variety of topics, including causal inference, statistical learning and interdisciplinary studies with real data. My undergraduate research mainly focused on applied projects related to air pollution and COVID-19. There we develop and use statistical methods to evaluate air pollution in China, and help with the evaluation and prediction of the global pandemic (see my [publications](https://imyaxuan.github.io/publications/) for details). Now I'm working with Professor [Peng Ding](https://sites.google.com/site/pengdingpku/home?authuser=0) on causal inference. 

Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect.
